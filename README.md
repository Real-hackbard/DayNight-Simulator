A solar equinox is a moment in time when the Sun appears [directly above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith) the equator, rather than to its north or south. On the day of the equinox, the Sun appears to rise directly east and set directly west. This occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September.

This program can display the equinox using data from the local system. First, the time and date are determined before the data is plotted. The current time determines the position of the sun, which appears as a yellow dot. The calculation can be displayed step-by-step, in a simulation, or saved as a bitmap.

Systematically observing the [sunrise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise), people discovered that it occurs between two extreme locations at the [horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon) and eventually noted the midpoint between the two. Later it was realized that this happens on a day when the duration of the day and the night are practically equal and the word "equinox" comes from Latin aequus, meaning "equal", and nox, meaning "night".

In other words, the equinoxes are the only times when the [subsolar point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsolar_point) is on the equator, meaning that the Sun is exactly overhead at a point on the equatorial line. The subsolar point crosses the equator moving northward at the March equinox and southward at the September equinox.
